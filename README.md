CVC Module Files
=================

This is a set of module files for CVC software on both TACC and ICES systems.
It has (or will have) all the CVC programs that are commonly used. To use any
of these modules, just clone the repository, and then run the command:

    module use <path_to_repo>/<syschoice>

where `<syschoice>` is `TACC` for TACC systems or `ICES` for machines that are 
accessing software located on /org/centers/cvc.

You should then have the modules available to you, and can access software
by loading the appropriate module, e.g.

    module load f2dock
